## About Jay

Hi, I’m Jay.

I’m currently a front-end engineer at Apple.

I was previously a creative technologist at AKQA, a data journalist at H2O.ai, and an intern at the MIT Media Lab.

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics, a minor in GIST, a certificate in New Media, and a desire to create great data visualization.

I love to read books, play board games (current favorites are Power Grid & Agricola), and take photos.
