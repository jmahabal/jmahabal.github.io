For our honeymoon we visited the Azores, an amazingly beautiful Portuguese island chain in the Atlantic.

## Getting There + Getting Around

When we visited in mid-2025 SATA Azores Airlines was offering one direct flight a day to Ponta Delgada, the largest city in the Azores, from JFK. This made it the perfect getaway destination.

Unfortunately, our flight was rescheduled by a day on both ends because the frequency of the flights dropped. Since the airline is on the smaller side and doesn’t have the resources to build out the web capabilities that other airlines have, all I got as an update was a text message (not even an email!) We had to re-book our hotels to accommodate the change. Thankfully SATA Azores customer service line was very helpful and checking in at the airport was straightforward.

The flight itself was uneventful. For both flying into PDL and coming back, it wasn’t full so we got a row to ourselves. The flight duration is around 5 hours and there’s no personal TV screen, so you have to “cachorro cru” it, as they say.

One other advance booking you absolutely have to make is for a rental car. Some of my favorite moments were pulling over on the side of the road when we saw a viewpoint (miradouro) that looked interesting. It’s pretty easy to book a car, the two companies we used were Amazing Island and Isla Verde. Isla Verde specifically had cars on Flores, which is a much smaller island.

Speaking of Flores, we visited two islands this trip: São Miguel, which is the biggest island, and Flores, one of the smaller islands, and you can fly between them. Our flight to Flores from São Miguel took around an hour.

## São Miguel

We landed around sunrise and proceeded through immigration. There were a couple of other international flights landing at the same time, I think it’s a popular time to land! Once we’d collected our luggage, we set out to get our car. While some companies operate out of the airport parking lot, the company we had chosen picked us up in a sprinter van and drove us five minutes away to their location. I was initially apprehensive about this, especially around dropping off the car and needing to get back to the airport, but it wasn’t a hassle at all.

I think that’ll be a recurring theme — this is an island and while things can move slowly and on their own time, it’s also easier to do things across the board since there aren’t that many people. Getting to the airport 45 minutes before your flight (if you don’t have luggage) is fine!

Our hotel was in the Furnas region so we headed east. Since our hotel room wasn’t ready for us we started exploring the island after a quick nap and breakfast pick-me-up.

Our first stop was the Miradouro Pico do Ferro, a short hike up to what was one of my favorite viewpoints on the island. This was in the first few hours of being on the island, so we knew we were in for a good time.

From there, we went to see the Cascada Salto da Farinha. We forgot to bring water, so we couldn’t go on for too long. Still, the benefit of hiking in the Azores is you’re always guaranteed a beautiful experience and provided it isn’t foggy, a beautiful view!

Other highlights of this first day included the Parque Natural da Ribeira dos Caldeirões, especially the waterfall on the other side.

Our second day kicked off with us walking around Furnas and eating breakfast, which was included bolos lêvedos, an English muffin-esque bread that’s popular in the Azores.

### Terra Nostra

This is a beautiful garden + hot springs in Furnas. If you stay at the attached hotel you get free admission before and after the public visiting hours. This makes it really nice for a morning or evening soak since you have the entire place to yourself.

### Salto do Prego

One of our favorite hikes this trip was to the Cascata do Salto do Prego.

Initially, we got lost since putting the attraction into Apple / Google Maps leads to the “wrong” trailhead. Thankfully a local hiker helped us out. While we were lost though, we met another couple who were also lost, and we ended up seeing them three more times over the course of our trip!

When you get to the “right” trailhead though it’s straightforward. The path up is pretty easy. We took a lot of breaks to look at the wild chickens and the baby chicks!

On the way back you should take the alternate path and walk through Sanguinho, a village that’s been renovated for eco-tourism. There’s also a cafe there where you can enjoy a post-hike beer or coffee. We talked to the barista and he told us there were nine cats in the area? We only saw like seven, though 😿.

We stopped by a few more miradouros and then grabbed pizza for dinner before hopping in the Terra Nostra pool for an evening dip, since we needed to wake up early tomorrow.

### Lagoa do Fogo

This is one of the more popular places on the island so you can’t take your car between 9-7pm. But you can before then, which I recommend! We managed to get minimal fog. You’re able to see basically the entire island!

### Ermida de Nossa Senhora da Paz

Located on the south side of the island, this chapel is a popular location for photos due to its striking staircase to the top and beautiful views.

### Sete Cidades

Sete Cidades is on the western side of the island. When we went it was unfortunately very foggy, and we couldn’t see much on our hikes. What a contrast to the bright and sunny southern coast we had just been at!

When you do get to the miradouro at the top, I recommend going on to the roof of the abandoned hotel. It’s relatively easy to get into and you get a beautiful view from the top.

The next day we headed to the Arquipélago (a Contemporary Art Center) in Ribeira Grande.

### Porto Formoso and Gorreana Tea Plantations

There are two tea plantations in Europe and both of them are on São Miguel! Gorreana is the more tourist-y of the two, but we actually liked it better! There’s a trail that snakes through the plantation that’s a lot of fun. When we walked it there was a farmer with his goat herd and dog.

We ended the day by swinging by the Caldeiras da Lagoa das Furnas and the [---], which was a feet soaking pool that mixed the natural hot waters of the area and a cold spring. It was so cool that there was something so small and special that we were able to walk by and see.

## Dolphins

Ignore the terrible photo. We saw a ton of whales and dolphins on this three hour cruise on our last day in the Azores. We took the --- cruise, but there are a bunch of operators. Ours promised a "money-back garuantee".

## Flores

When we mentioned that we were going to Flores to a local, he told us that’s where he goes to “get away from the big city.”

We overheard a conversation in Flores about how there were no longer any children born on the island. There are still kids, but women who are pregnant travel to nearby islands with hospitals to give birth, before coming back. There used to be an OBGYN on the island, but she retired and passed away some years ago apparently! We also learned that while there are commercial flights, the Portuguese air force can be called in for emergencies if needed.

### Fajã de Lopo Vaz

A hike that I will think of for the rest of my life is PRC04 Fajã de Lopo Vaz. It’s on the southern part of the island, and as you walk down to the beach along the cliffside you have stunning views of the ocean. There isn’t as much at the bottom, and the walk back up sucks, but the views are incredible.

## Cats

One of the most pleasant of surprises was how many cats are on the islands. They’re just hanging out and can usually take a good pet. We did see one attack a chicken though!

## Miradouros

There are so many places where you can park on the side of the road and enjoy a stunning view. I thought I’d get tired of them by the end but I still ended up pulling over every time. No regrets!

## Flowers

There are sooooo many flowers. We even came a little after the peak of the season. Both hydrangeas and ---- aren’t native to the islands, even though they’ve now become iconic and were the types we saw most of.

## Food and Drink

I wish I drank more espresso.

The food was a mixed bag for us. The local delicacy was this bread that was reminiscent of an english muffin. The cheese was also supposed to be special but tbh was mainly okay.

We went to the gin library, which was a lot of fun. They basically only serve gin and tonics, and you get to pick the gin from their huge collection. They had a guy selling nachos, which was a perfect pairing. We walked in without reservations but I’d recommend them!
